Recent events have put students, teachers, and parents in [new territory](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/wyzant-covid-19-response-and-student-guidance/). Schools are closed. Children are home for days on end. Getting started as an at-home, ad hoc educator is certainly daunting, but never fear! Experts in learning at home are mobilized all over the web to provide resources for parents in this troubling time. Many educational sites that normally charge for membership are waiving their fees for the duration of school closures. The world of online education has tons to offer, and odds are that if you found this article, you're looking for expert advice. 

## Create an at-home school schedule

No matter what your child’s classes look like now, establishing a routine is important for learning at home. Start with making a daily schedule for children of all ages who are home all day, that keeps them actively engaged in their education. Though there is no one-size-fits-all plan, here are some guidelines: 

### Write up a basic plan for how your day will look

Start and end the day at the same time, and work on material in the same subjects at the same time of the day, each day. Schedule meals and other breaks at the same times. This gives the day predictability and holds you and your at-home student accountable. But it is also important to be flexible so a lesson or activity taking more time that you planned doesn’t throw everyone's entire day into chaos.

### Plan time for subjects
Much in the same way that subjects are divided throughout the day while your kids are in the classroom, create a plan that includes all the subjects your student is learning. Decide how much time to allot per subject based on what time you and your kids are most alert, and (of course) devote more time for subjects that need a boost. 

### Include "recess"
Even if your kids can't play outside with other kids, they still need some time to exercise, take a breather, and relax. Breaks are a great idea. While you're all working on schoolwork, alternate between active time and seated time, especially with children under five, or kids of any age who have trouble sitting still. 

Remember: you need a breather, too! This cannot be stressed enough: take plenty of breaks. Balance is important any time, but especially during a change in routine. 

## Get a tutor's help

Getting a tutor when your child is struggling academically, or just needs some outside support, is a good idea even in "normal" academic times. When school is on hold, it can make an even bigger difference. Private tutoring benefits your child by giving them one-on-one instruction from an expert, structure in their week, and accountability for their learning. It also takes the burden off your shoulders (and your child’s exasperated teacher's) so you can manage your own routine. 

When you're ready to chat with a [potential online tutor](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/questions-to-ask-tutors/), Wyzant lets you search tutors by subject, age group, subject expertise, location, cost, and more.

## Take a virtual field trip

Field trips are kid favorites. They’re indispensable experiences that get students out into the world, exploring new things and discovering new interests. Trips to museums, zoos, parks, historical sites, and other perennial favorites illustrate to students that learning isn’t just for the classroom, and is happening everywhere, all the time. The things students discover on field trips put classroom content into context, inspire questions, and fuel a desire for learning.

Just because everything is closed doesn’t mean you can’t go on a field trip. You can visit many locations of cultural, historic, and natural importance by virtual tour! The number of places offering these tours has increased due to the recent closings of public places, as artists, musicians, cultural icons, and scientists rush to make content that helps kids who are learning at home. Virtual field trips unlock the ability for parents-turned-teachers to take their students to incredible places, and help them learn amazing things, without the need to leave the house.

## Non-electronic activities for kids

If your household has rules about screen time, it might be hard to stick to them when many things that used to be in-person are now online. However, that doesn’t mean that you can’t make a point of encouraging your kids entertain themselves without electronics. 

To keep kids busy indoors when their usual games and toys aren’t cutting it, go for something that is engaging and feels special. Making [homemade play-dough](https://www.thebestideasforkids.com/playdough-recipe/), slime, or [play mud](https://www.thebestideasforkids.com/make-play-mud/) is not only fun, but provides sensory stimulation and an opportunity to work on their recipe-following skills. You could [get them involved with cooking](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/packages/recipes-for-kids/cooking-with-kids) in fun, age-appropriate ways. This could also be a great time for your kids (and maybe for you as well) to learn a new hobby like [sewing](https://www.sewcanshe.com/blog/sewing-projects-for-kids), [knitting](https://www.howweelearn.com/knitting-for-kids/), yoga, origami, or playing an instrument. 

If you can, it’s important to get outdoors every so often. Even if your state is under shelter in place, going for walks and riding bikes are still permitted. Just remember to follow the CDC’s directive to avoid congregating and stay six feet away from other people. If you have a yard or access to a nearby park, take full advantage of it with outdoor games, nature crafts, and learning about plants and wildlife. [This guide](https://outdoorfamiliesonline.com/free-outdoor-learning-kid-activities/?fbclid=IwAR3EQodydDF3Pocb1URAAGOQmrmIqUuRK09xIpjaNVtj3I-RC1jFzU63lks) is a great place to look for ideas if you’re stuck.
