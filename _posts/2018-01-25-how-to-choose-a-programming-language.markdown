*Are you a natural problem solver who’s curious about coding? Do you have an idea for a website or app and need to build your skills to bring your concept to life? If so, you may be wondering where to start.*

*With all of the programming languages and resources available today, taking the first steps can be daunting. We reached out to our friend Adam Levenson at Thinkful, who put together the below overview and recommendations to help you choose your first programming language and begin the learning process.*

## What is programming, anyway?

While programming can be defined as “writing instructions for computers to execute,” it really is all about problem solving.  As a programmer, you need to give your computer very specific, understandable instructions for each thing you want it to do – whether that involves simply displaying the text on a webpage in a certain color or manipulating data in a complex database. These types of actions require you to solve problems and give clear instructions to your computer. Learning to code, then, is the process of learning how to solve problems in a structured way, and then translating those solutions into instructions a computer can understand and implement. These instructions are written in programming languages.

There are many programming languages powering the websites and apps you use every day, but we recommend that you pick one and learn to master it. Once you understand the fundamentals of programming, it will be easier for you to learn other languages and frameworks.

## Picking a programming language

So, which programming language should you learn first? The answer depends on your goals and the type of project you’d like to tackle. We suggest taking these five factors into account when selecting a language to learn.

### 1. The popularity of the language

Consider starting with a popular programming language. More popularity generally means a larger community of developers and more resources, which makes learning and debugging easier. When you’re starting out, it’s especially helpful if you can take advantage of other developers’ expertise. When you run into issues with a popular language and search for solutions online, you’ll likely find that other developers have encountered and solved the same problem and documented their experiences.

### 2. Accessibility

Look for languages with easier syntax first. This way, you can focus on learning to code, rather than educating yourself on the nuances of a particular language. The foundation will serve you well, and make learning new languages easier in the future.

### 3. Job prospects

If you’re interested in making a career change, research languages that are in high demand. If you visit job sites like Indeed, you can see how many job openings there are for a particular language and use that information to guide your decision.

### 4. Longevity

Look for languages that are likely to be used for many years down the road, so your skills aren’t out of date. Research the languages that are used on large, popular websites, and explore [Github](https://github.com/) to see which languages have staying power. Even as new versions of a language emerge, having a strong foundation in a reliable language will allow you to catch up quickly and build upon your skills.

### 5. Your objective

You now probably have a sense of what languages are popular, in demand, and accessible to beginners. Next, think about your own goals and objectives.  This will be the single most helpful way to choose the programming language that’s right for you. Are you interested in creating a consumer-facing website or application? If so, consider using a popular front-end language, like JavaScript. If you’d like to start with a back-end project, like building an app that does something and stores data, JavaScript and Python both make excellent choices. Python is also a great option if you’re interested in data and analytics.

## Overview of JavaScript and Python

Whether your interests lie in front-end development, back-end development, or data analysis, JavaScript and Python are great for beginners and used constantly by veteran programmers and data scientists. Below is a quick overview of these two languages to help guide you in your decision.

### JavaScript

About 94% of all websites use JavaScript. JavaScript has a monopoly on front-end development, as sites like Facebook, Amazon, and Google are all built with JavaScript. The language is versatile and can be used for both front-end and back-end development. If you’d like to practice your JavaScript skills by building a full-stack application, you can do that even without learning additional languages.

### Python

In 2017, Python was the second most popular programming language [according to Github.com](https://octoverse.github.com/). It is used regularly by data scientists, and is great for big data analysis. If you’re looking for a programming language that will help you gain insights from your data and make data-driven business decisions, learning Python gives you an advantage. George McIntire, a mentor in Thinkful’s [Los Angeles coding bootcamp](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/los-angeles/), adds that “Python’s main strength is its intuitiveness; the way it’s designed just makes sense.”

## How to learn to code

Now that you’ve done your research, it’s time to start learning. There are many paths you can take when learning to code, no matter which language you choose. You may choose to build your skills and knowledge in a formal degree program, like [Stanford’s](https://scpd.stanford.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=1240861). Technology schools like [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/) are gaining popularity as well, offering a streamlined curriculum, fast-paced immersive programs, and even career services. You can also take advantage of free online resources like [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) or [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and teach yourself coding concepts or supplement the knowledge you gain in a more structured program.

Learning to code is difficult, especially if you’re coming from a non-technical background. The best thing you can do is to seek help from a knowledgeable mentor or tutor. Their guidance will help you learn faster, stay committed, and even [achieve more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_Sigma_Problem). There are no limits to what you can achieve with the help of an expert tutor – and you can often attend tutoring sessions from anywhere in the world, on a schedule that works for you.

Wyzant has a network of [over 23k coding tutors](https://www.wyzant.com/coding_tutors.aspx). Search for a tutor with expertise in the languages and technologies you’re interested in, and start lessons as soon as you’re ready to dive into programming. 

Happy coding!
