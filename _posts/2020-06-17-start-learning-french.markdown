Do you want to start learning French as a second language, but not know where to start? The internet has made great strides in the availability of foreign language education. The information you need to learn French at home is out there - classes, apps, English to French books, tutoring, and other French for beginners programs, but how do you figure out what will work best for you? What’s the best way to learn French online? That depends on you, but if you follow these steps to learning French, you’ll start off on the right foot. 

## How to learn French on your own

Self-directed French study is definitely possible if you put enough work into it. Is French hard? Some people have an easier time than others. Whether you’re naturally suited to language learning or not, there are ways you can set yourself up for success.

Start by setting achievable, specific goals. If you’re stuck on that, think about when you would consider yourself “fluent” and what you want to do when you reach that level. Your goals could be something like going on a trip, communicating with French-speakers at work, reading certain literature in French, or watching films without English subtitles. 

Once you’ve set your goals, stick to a schedule. How long does it take to learn French? Educators recommend seven hours per week of work to become conversational in a year. You can distribute those hours in whatever way you prefer, but try to consistently work during a time of the day when you’re at your most alert. Choose how you spend those hours based on what you need to work on the most.

Having the right attitude is just as important as using the right study materials. If you go into learning French with an attitude of curiosity instead of obligation to meet certain milestones, it will be easier to maintain your enthusiasm over time

## Avoid common language-learning mistakes

Self-directed study may be liberating, but it’s important not to pick up bad habits in the process. Mistakes are an important part of learning, but mistakes in your approach that become habits might take more time and effort to correct than they would if you nipped them in the bud.

Some examples of these mistakes include using an approach that doesn’t match the way you learn, setting vague goals, getting discouraged by your mistakes, focusing on the wrong vocabulary, not asking for help, thinking immersion requires moving to another country, and thinking it has to be hard.

Learning how to establish good habits instead of these bad ones will get you on the right track sooner.

## Learn the Grammar

French grammar can be intimidating for beginners. There are a lot of different conjugation types, and some concepts simply do not exist in English - like grammatical gender, having two different words for “you,” and making adjectives plural like the noun. However, that doesn’t mean it isn’t hackable. Though a little rote memorization is unavoidable, the best thing you can do to learn French grammar is **look for patterns**. 

Unlike English, every French rule exists on purpose. Since the seventeenth century, a forty-member institution called L’académie Française has codified every part of French grammar. Because of that intentionality, many French grammar rules make more sense than their English counterparts.

The clearest example of this are plurals. You won’t find anything like mouse/mice in French because there are fewer exceptions to the general rule that adding an -s to the end of a word makes it plural. There is some weird stuff tossed in the mix to keep non-native speakers on our toes, though. How else would they explain “le squelette”?

## Learn French tenses

Whether you consider yourself a French beginner or are already well on your way to fluency, French verb tenses probably give you a headache. There are more than 20 of them! French grammar also uses *les modes* (moods) to indicate how a speaker feels about an action, which changes just how many ways there truly are to express a complete (and grammatically correct) thought. 

The three main tenses - past, present, and future - are the right place to begin. Understanding the nuances of each of these tenses will make learning all those moods even simpler.

### French Present Tense Conjugations

The most logical place to start learning how to conjugate French verbs is with the present tense. It’s both the easiest and allows you to communicate the most concepts. There are three kinds of regular French verbs: -er verbs, -ir verbs, and -re verbs, each with different conjugation patterns.
