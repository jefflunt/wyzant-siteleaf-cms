Tests are required for so many things in both education and employment, from the SAT for college admission to the LSAT for law school qualification to the USMLE exam for medical licensure. Admission into the Armed Services is no different, as the military has connections to both employment and education. The test to qualify for the U.S. Armed Forces is called the ASVAB. 

[What is the ASVAB](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/understanding-the-asvab-test-and-what-its-used-for/)? It stands for Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, and it’s just that—a battery of tests designed to test your aptitude for vocations within the Armed Services. It consists of 8-10 subtests devised to test your knowledge and ability every area relevant to military jobs: General Science, Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, Mathematics Knowledge, Electronics Information, Mechanical Comprehension, Auto and Shop Knowledge, and Assembling Objects.

Like all standardized tests, the ASVAB comes with a host of scores that represent your performance on the test.  It also comes in multiple versions that are similar but have important differences. In the end, you may be confused as to just what test to take and what scores you’re shooting for. When it comes to your dream of becoming a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, understanding ASVAB scoring is critical to achieving that goal.

## 1. The most important score of all—your AFQT score
Before any other section scores or subscores are considered, the military will look at your AFQT score. Standing for Armed Forces Qualifying Test, the AFQT is composed of the reading and math sections in the ASVAB: Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Mathematics Knowledge. The scores from those sections are combined and then translated into a percentile, so your AFQT score will tell you what percent of ASVAB takers you did better than. All the subtests of the ASVAB are percentile score ranging from 1 to 99.

In order to enlist in any of the branches of the military, you will need to meet the minimum AFQT requirement for a specific branch. The most selective branch is the Coast Guard, which requires a minimum score of 40 to enlist—meaning that you need to score better than 40% of all other test takers to qualify. The score requirements for the other branches range from 31 (Army) to 32 (Marines) to 35 (Navy) to 36 (Air Force). 

It’s important to remember that those minimums are conditional upon the potential enlistee having earned a high school diploma. If you do not have a diploma, you can still get into the Armed Forces with a GED high-school equivalency, but the range of minimum AFQT scores then jumps to 50-65, depending on the branch of the military. It’s important to keep in mind as well that less than 5% of recruits with GEDs instead of diplomas achieve qualifying scores on the ASVAB.

## 2. The many faces of of the ASVAB
Three versions of the ASVAB that are used for enlistment purposes, and one is used for recruiting. How long is the ASVAB? Well, that all depends on which version you take.

* The Student ASVAB is a paper-and-pencil test administered to high school and college students for recruitment purposes. Approximately 3 hours in length and composed of 8 subtests, this version is administered in an institutional setting such as a high school, college, or vocational school. Your test results and an interest inventory (“Find Your Interests”) will be sent to your school so that you and your counselor can explore possible careers. Through this post-test interpretation, you can explore different occupations, identify a college major, and learn more about your personality.  
* The MET-site ASVAB is almost identical to the Student ASVAB but is administered at a Mobile Examination Test site and is used for enlistment purposes. Although it also includes the Assembling Objects subtest, that section is strictly for research purposes, so it will not count toward your scores. Because of that extra section, the MET-site ASVAB is closer to 3½ hours long. 
* The CAT-ASVAB is taken on a computer (CAT stands for Computer-Adaptive Test) and can be completed in as little as 1½ hours.  Given at a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS), the CAT-ASVAB is self-paced, but once an answer is selected it cannot be changed.  If a correct answer is chosen, you are given a harder question.  If an incorrect answer is chosen, an easier question is given.  You want the difficult questions rather than the easy ones, as your score will be higher the more of those you can get correct. This version of the test has 10 subtests, as it includes Assembling Objects and splits Auto and Shop Information into separate sections.
* The PiCAT (Pre-screening internet-delivered Computer Adaptive Test) is identical to the ASVAB, but it is not proctored or timed. You are permitted to take it at home. You may wonder—what’s to keep you from cheating? Well, technically nothing, but you will receive a brief follow-up exam when you turn in the PiCAT to your recruiter. That exam is proctored and supervised, and if your results on that test support the results of the PiCAT, your at-home scores will replace the official ASVAB results. 

While the PiCAT is great for people with test anxiety because it eliminates the timing and monitoring of the regular ASVAB, it is an option only in certain circumstances. If you have taken the ASVAB at a MEPS, or if you have taken the Student ASVAB, you are not eligible for PiCAT. In addition, if you took the ASVAB previously and were not happy with your scores, you will not have access to PiCAT.

## 3. The score report for the ASVAB beyond just your AFQT score 
If you have taken the Student ASVAB, your Summary Results sheet will be sent to your school counselor. About two weeks after the exam you will receive your test scores and a copy of Exploring Careers: The ASVAB Career Exploration Guide, which includes an interest inventory (“Find Your Interests”) to help determine what career fields or occupations are more satisfying to you.

The ASVAB score report will include your AFQT score, your scores on the individual subtests, and three Career Exploration scores, which can be used to evaluate your knowledge and skills in three general areas:

1. Verbal Skills: Word Knowledge and Paragraph Comprehension
2. Math Skills: Arithmetic Reasoning and Math Knowledge
3. Science and Technical Skills: General Science, Electronics Information, and Mechanical Comprehension

If you want to remember how to read ASVAB scores, keep in mind that each subtest yields a percentile score from 1 to 99, and those section scores are then combined into various composite scores depending on the occupation and the military branch offering it.

In addition to your score report, you will receive a book titled Military Careers, which summarizes the requirements and responsibilities of selected occupations across all the Armed Services. This book will provide information on military training and occupations for both officers and enlisted personnel, as well as describe the relationships between comparable military and civilian occupational fields. Each occupation has a specific Military Careers score that is a composition of different ASVAB subtests, depending on the job.

Using your Career Exploration and Military Careers scores, you will be able to gather information on your specific skill areas and gain an understanding of which military careers are best suited to your current knowledge and abilities. If you fail to achieve the minimum AFQT score on your initial attempt, knowing what scores correlate to your preferred military jobs will give you something to aim for on the retest.

## 4. The required scores for your preferred job in the military
For those of you who are looking to enlist, you’ll want to know what subtests on the ASVAB are most critical to your desired occupation. Each occupation has minimum requirements for certain subtests, but there are also basic requirements for broader areas of occupation within each branch of the military. 

In the Army, for example, your ASVAB scores will be categorized into 10 composite score areas known as “line scores.” For each occupational field within the Army, the line score represents the sum of the critical ASVAB subtest scores for that field:

* **Clerical**: Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Mathematics Knowledge.
* **Combat**: Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Auto and Shop Knowledge, and Mechanical Comprehension.
* **Electronics**: General Science, Arithmetic Reasoning, Mathematics Knowledge, and Electronic Information.
* **Field Artillery**: Arithmetic Reasoning, Mathematics Knowledge, and Mechanical Comprehension.
* **General Maintenance**: General Science, Auto and Shop Knowledge, Mathematics Knowledge, and Electronics Information.
* **General Technical**: Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, and Arithmetic Reasoning.
* **Mechanical Maintenance**: Auto and Shop Knowledge, Mechanical Comprehension, and Electronic Information.
* **Operators and Food**: Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Auto and Shop Knowledge, and Mechanical Comprehension.
* **Surveillance and Communications**: Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, Auto and Shop Knowledge, and Mechanical Comprehension.
* **Skilled Technical**: Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, General Science, Mechanical Comprehension, and Mathematics Knowledge.

Each individual occupation in the Army corresponds to a [particular line score](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/asvab/asvab-and-army-jobs.html). For example, you would have to get a General Maintenance score of at least 88 to qualify as a Firefighter. Remember, though, that the minimum score will not guarantee placement in your desired occupation. Other recruits are competing for the same occupation, so the better you score on the ASVAB, the greater chance you have of getting your dream job. 

There are similar listings available online for both the [Marines](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/asvab/asvab-and-marine-corps-jobs.html), which also uses line scores, and for the [Air Force](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/asvab/asvab-and-air-force-jobs.html), which uses qualification area scores.

Rather than using line scores, the [Navy](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/asvab-and-navy-mos-jobs.html) and the [Coast Guard](http://asvabpreptests.com/index.php/asvab/coastguard.html) provide the requirements for each individual occupation. They both call their enlisted jobs “ratings” and attach a composite score of different ASVAB subtests, depending on the occupation. For example, a rating of Airman in the Navy requires that you get a score of at least 185: Arithmetic Reasoning + Auto & Shop Information + Mathematics Knowledge + Verbal Expression (a composite of Word Knowledge and Paragraph Comprehension). In the Coast Guard, a rating of Gunner’s Mate requires a score of 208: Arithmetic Reasoning + Mathematics Knowledge + Electronics Information + General Science.  

Comprehensive lists for the all branches of the military can be found in [PDF form](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/ASVAB_Scores_for_Military_Jobs.pdf) online.

## 5. The best way to prepare for an ASVAB retake
You are permitted to take the ASVAB multiple times in an attempt to reach the necessary AFQT minimum, but under most circumstances you won’t be allowed to retake it simply to raise your score once you have achieved a qualifying AFQT score. After the first and second attempts, you will have to wait 30 days to take the ASVAB again. After that third attempt, however, you must wait six months before you’ll be eligible to take it a fourth time. Your scores stay on your record for two years, 

Because achieving that minimum AFQT score is your primary goal, having access to quality ASVAB test prep is essential. Getting yourself an [experienced tutor](https://www.wyzant.com/AFOQT_tutors.aspx) who can guide you through the ASVAB math and language arts sections will enable you to capitalize on your test retake. A good tutor will identify which areas need the most work and then direct you in the best ways to shore up those weaknesses. You should complete as many ASVAB practice tests as you can, then go over them with your tutor. 

If you have reviewed your previous scores and identified some military careers that you’re interested in, then you know which subtests you need to score highly on beyond just the AFQT sections. You should look into obtaining a proven ASVAB study guide and an ASVAB expert to assist you in the preparation process. Having access to a skilled [ASVAB tutor](https://www.wyzant.com/ASVAB_tutors.aspx) can go a long way toward reaching your goal of starting a career in the military and serving in the United States Armed Forces.
