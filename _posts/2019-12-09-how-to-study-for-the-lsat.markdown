Your LSAT score is easily the most crucial element of your law school admission, and the school you attend has significant impact on the trajectory of your law career. Preparation is key; put in the time and study, and you can expect improvement.

## What is the LSAT?

The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is an integral part of the admission process. It assesses critical reading comprehension, analytical and [logical reasoning](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/lsat-logical-reasoning/), and writing skills. The LSAT is the only test accepted for admission purposes by all ABA-accredited law schools and Canadian common-law law schools.

The LSAT is administered in two parts:

1. A multiple-choice exam administered at official test centers

2. A written essay (LSAT Writing), administered online

The test consists of four scored sections, one experimental section, and an unscored essay section. Two of the scored sections are Logical Reasoning, one is Reading Comprehension, and the last is Analytical Reasoning - commonly known as Logic Games. Each scored section is 35 minutes on test day, and requires its own targeted method of study. The LSAT is not a test that rewards last-minute cramming, so law school hopefuls should consider their strategy and prepare thoroughly.

There’s a lot to achieve during your LSAT prep. Where to start? Here are some key tips to get you on track to a perfect 180.

## How to Study for the LSAT

### 1. Register for your LSAT Date

Pick the LSAT test date that works best for you and [register with the LSAC](https://www.lsac.org/). Signing up for the exam costs $200 (read more about other charges [here](https://www.lsac.org/lsat/lsat-dates-deadlines-score-release-dates/lsat-cas-fees-and-refunds)). The registration deadline for the LSAT is approximately one month before the test. You should register 6-8 weeks before your test date in order to secure your spot, avoid late fees, and begin preparation. Here are the LSAT testing dates for the first half of 2020:

You should schedule your LSAT early enough that your scores will be available at the time of your first law school application deadline. The [Princeton Review suggests](https://www.princetonreview.com/law-school-advice/when-to-take-the-lsat) submitting applications between late September and early November - the time of year when most law schools begin their applicant reviews.

Typically, students applying for fall admission should take the LSAT during the previous calendar year. Since LSAT prep should clock in at a minimum of 120 hours over a few months, getting registered is key to beginning your prep.

### 2. Create Your LSAT Study Schedule

With your perfect score in mind, you can begin planning your prep...and preparing for the LSAT is no easy task. It takes time and focused effort to understand the format of the test and master the specificities - and ambiguities - of each section. Any student planning to take the LSAT should create a study schedule that they can stick to over a 3-4 month period. Many LSAT students choose to prep using classes or [private tutoring sessions](https://www.wyzant.com/LSAT_tutors.aspx), especially those who intend to gain admission into a top 12 law school.

As noted above, aim for a minimum of 120 hours of dedicated LSAT study. Arrange your schedule to make time for LSAT study at least 1-2 hours a day, 4-5 days a week. Some LSAT experts suggest the time spent taking practice tests should be *in addition* to their students’ regular study schedule, but your strategy may differ. To stay organized and on track, block out your study time on a calendar, schedule breaks, and reach out for help when you hit a roadblock.

### 3. Understand your perfect score

The LSAT typically contains between 99 and 101 questions, and the total number of questions answered correctly determines your score. There are 3 different LSAT scores: raw, scaled, and percentile:

The average LSAT score is around 150; if you’re hoping for admission into a top 25 law school, though, your score goal may be 160 or higher. The [Magoosh LSAT Blog](https://magoosh.com/lsat/2016/lsat-scores-top-100-law-schools/) writes, “Some law school admissions departments openly claim that LSAT scores make up 70% of a student’s admissions chances, with the other 30% attributed to GPA. You read that right—the morning that you spent taking the LSAT might be more important than the four years you spent studying in college.

Law schools weigh your LSAT score differently than others. If you're in [New York](https://www.wyzant.com/New_York_LSAT_tutors.aspx) or [Chicago](https://www.wyzant.com/Chicago_LSAT_tutors.aspx), you're in two cities where the biggest law firms exist, and those cities have correspondingly prestigious law schools, each with differing standards for your LSAT score and undergrad GPA. Here are five of the toughest law schools to get into and how they approach those numbers:

* **Duke University:** LSAT 167-170; median undergrad GPA 3.78

* **Stanford University School of Law:** LSAT 168-173; median undergrad GPA 3.92

* **Harvard University:** LSAT 170-175; median undergrad GPA 3.90

* **Columbia University School of Law:** LSAT 168-174; median undergrad GPA 3.70

* **University of Chicago Law School:** LSAT 166-172; median undergrad GPA 3.90

  *(source: Princeton Review)*

The good news is: the LSAT is a test where prep genuinely counts. You can raise your score by 30 or more points just by learning ideal study strategies and time management from an experienced LSAT expert.

### 4. Take timed LSAT practice tests

An agreed-upon rule of thumb among most LSAT tutors is to begin taking practice tests several months in advance of your exam date, and to continue taking them over the course of your test prep. The goals of taking LSAT practice tests are numerous:

* To learn techniques and strategies that will help you answer the diverse material on the test accurately

* To help you gain a strong sense of timing so you’re able to devote more time to difficult questions

* To identify your weaknesses

* To reinforce concepts, strengthen comprehension, and assess your progress

* To understand how to use questions you previously answered wrong to approach similar questions

* To learn to “think on your feet” and attack each question confidently

* To reduce test-day anxiety

LSAT prep tests are crucial. During the course of your prep, you should plan to take at least four full-length tests, and many tutors and prep experts prescribe even more. Since the LSAT clocks in around 3 hours and 45 minutes, be sure to include four-hour blocks in your LSAT study schedule to accommodate uninterrupted practice test sessions.

### 5. Double down on Logical Reasoning

Two of the four sections scored on the LSAT are logical reasoning. This means that half your LSAT score depends on your mastery of logical reasoning questions alone. Questions in Logical Reasoning contain a stimulus (typically two to three sentences long), a question stem, and five answer choices. These questions are designed to challenge and test your reading ability, your capacity for reason, and your mental discipline.

They’re also designed to confuse, which requires you to consider topics and ideas in new, and often unfamiliar, ways. 25 questions over 35 minutes means you’ll have around 1:20 for each one. Remember, though: certain questions are specially designed to take less time, while their counterparts are meant to take longer to answer. Training yourself to encounter, analyze, and answer them well under ideal study conditions is key to a high percentile score.

### 6. Practice process of elimination

Your LSAT practice test scores and study sessions will allow you to observe and track your progress, and highlight areas that need work. Being aware of your current skill level and how far it is from your perfect score can be a powerful, motivating tool for staying on track. However, when facing down a difficult question with numerous multiple-choice answers, using a Process of Elimination (POE) method can be a helpful strategy in increasing your score.

Attacking questions using POE is easy to understand. In both the Reading Comprehension and Logical Reasoning sections, answer choices can usually be justified with some creative mental gymnastics - the writers of the test understand how to obfuscate, and law professionals need to understand how to dissect complex information. POE allows you to focus on why certain answers are wrong rather than right, thereby informing your final choice among fewer options.

Read a question’s choices and eliminate answers that are clearly incorrect. Also, include answers that have glaring flaws in logic, obvious ambiguity, contradictory information, or other red flags. Even if you wind up guessing the most likely correct answer (see below), getting rid of obvious impostors can help you guess more accurately. By eliminating just *two* of a question’s possible choices, your chance of choosing the right answer increases from 20% to 33%.

### 7. Learn how to guess

Timing is everything on test day. Running out of time on one or more sections on the LSAT is a very common occurrence for most students. Even if you managed to finish under the wire during your practice LSAT tests, it’s likely you may not have the time you’d like for every single question. LSAT coaches stress the importance of grasping the test on a fundamental level before attempting to cut down time, but keep in mind: your score won’t decrease if you simply guess (and there are some [probabilities](https://www.powerscore.com/lsat/help/guessing.cfm) that govern how you should go about it). The total number of questions answered correctly determines your score.

That’s right: guessing the wrong answer in a time crunch doesn’t count against your score! According to [Powerscore](https://www.powerscore.com/lsat/help/guessing.cfm):

> “Because the LSAT does not assess a scoring penalty for incorrect answer choices, you should always guess on every question that you cannot complete during the allotted time. However, because some answer choices are historically more likely to occur than others, you should not guess randomly.”

## Some final LSAT advice

The LSAT is not a test of academic knowledge, but with the right study strategies, paired with prep alongside a seasoned LSAT expert, you can develop the skills you need to succeed. Each of your mistakes is an opportunity to improve. Why did you choose that answer? Why did you eliminate the correct answer? What did you miss about the argument? How about the question type? Are you noticing patterns in the types of questions you answer incorrectly? Find an [LSAT tutor](https://www.wyzant.com/LSAT_tutors.aspx) today who can help you sort out the answers to those questions, and keep you on track to a perfect score.
