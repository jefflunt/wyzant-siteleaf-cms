Back in February 2020, we announced that Wyzant was fast approaching the biggest milestone in our platform’s history - **10 million hours of lessons**. To celebrate, we decided to go big: the student whose lesson took Wyzant over the 10 million hour mark would receive an entire year of free tutoring, and their tutor would take home a prize of $1000.

Last week, I had the pleasure to interview Adarsh and his mom Hema, the lucky recipients of Wyzant’s 10 million hour giveaway! 

## The winning student

Adarsh lives with his mom, Hema, in the San Diego area. He's in his sophomore year of high school, now occurring virtually. Like most, it’s been a challenging transition for his school.

“Nobody knows what is going on right now,” were his exact words. Hopefully now, a few weeks into e-learning, they’re beginning to figure it out. 

Adarsh is a bright young man and very good student. As a sophomore, he’s taking 4 AP classes this year, and planning on 6-7 next year. His ultimate goal is to get into UCLA to study either medicine or engineering.

To do that, he’s aiming to get straight A's, high ACT scores and 5's on his AP exams.

Enter Wyzant. 

## Finding the right chemistry

In February, Adarsh started AP Chemistry, and knew it was going to be tough right away. That’s when he realized he wanted a tutor.

He looked in the App Store, where he found Wyzant's free app, and remembered hearing good things about our platform previously from his friends. After reviewing numerous tutor profiles with Hema, they chose Katie, a math and science tutor with a perfect five star rating.

The icing on the cake? She’s working toward a doctorate in dentistry at UCLA, Adarsh's dream school.

This was back in February, before social distancing became the norm, but Adarsh and Hema were clear from the beginning that they wanted the tutoring to take place online. 

“Adarsh is too busy to travel somewhere, and he’s very comfortable working online. We liked Wyzant because you can review all the tutors. I know my son, and what sort of tutor he needs. With Wyzant, I can help him find the right tutor.”

A few days after contacting Katie through Wyzant, they set up their first lesson. So far, Adarsh and Katie have had five sessions together, and he's is making tremendous progress. “Prior to Katie, I felt pretty awful and couldn’t understand half the material. Now when I go through the practice materials I really get it. Katie is a really great tutor. She’s so concise and on point, and she explains things really well.”

## The lucky tutor

I chatted with Katie, who's been tutoring on Wyzant in order to help pay the bills as a graduate student. Katie told me, “I like Wyzant because I get to work with great students on a part-time basis, and I get to keep more money than at previous tutoring jobs. Basically, I get to be my own boss.”

As for her work with Adarsh, she said, “Adarsh is a quick learner. He’s motivated, prepared, and easy-going.” On being a tutor, Katie added, “It’s really rewarding for me to work long-term with students and be able to see their progress. I love seeing the students make improvements and build their confidence.”

Wyzant awarded Katie a $1,000 prize for being the tutor to give the lesson that took us to our 10 millionth hour.

“I got it yesterday and used it right away to pay my rent, which in west LA is ridiculous!” Interestingly, Katie had only done in-person tutoring prior to COVID-19, and she’s been pleasantly surprised with Wyzant’s online learning tool.

“I love the online classroom, especially the fact that we can both upload documents and collaborate on them together. Plus, I save time and money not having to drive.” 

## Looking to the future

At the end of our conversation, I asked Hema and Adarsh how they planned to use their year of free tutoring. Not surprisingly, given Adarsh’s intense course load and sky-high goals, there will be lots of room for help. “He is going to need more help in writing and AP physics next year. And we’re already worried about organic chemistry!”

I've no doubt that in a few years time, they **all** will have achieved their goals; Adarsh will be studying at UCLA, and Katie a successful dentist. I look forward to checking back in with this group over the next year. Congratulations, Adarsh, Hema, and Katie!
