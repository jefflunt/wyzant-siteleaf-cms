As global uncertainty surrounding coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to increase, our top priority is the safety of tutors, students, and their loved ones. We recognize that the situation varies widely across school districts, universities and personal circumstances, and is creating unique challenges everywhere. The CDC’s directive of social distancing, and the resulting cancellation of classes, extracurriculars, and other events is given to keep kids and families healthy, but it’s also interrupted studies, social interaction, and academic progress. 

With current CDC recommendations on social distancing, **we highly recommend online lessons as a safe and effective teaching method**. Wyzant is committed to giving students the most productive online tutoring experience possible. Wyzant’s proprietary [online tutoring tool](https://online.wyzant.com/welcome/59b6109c9337/#/new) is available 24/7 at no extra cost. It consists of video chat, a virtual whiteboard and many other useful tools. You’ll find everything you need to know about using the online tool to stay connected to education goals in our [Help Center](https://support.wyzant.com/hc/en-us/articles/213447703-How-do-I-join-an-online-lesson-using-the-Wyzant-online-tool-).

We also urge you to be proactive in coordinating with your tutor over the next few weeks regarding availability and logistics of lessons.

At Wyzant HQ in Chicago, we have made the decision to close our office and work from home for the health and well-being of our employees. Fortunately, we are well-equipped for this transition, and you can expect the same high level of service and responsiveness from our team as always during this challenging time. We remain committed to helping tutors and students succeed. 

Thank you for your cooperation and flexibility. Most importantly, we want you and yours to remain healthy and safe. Please [contact Wyzant for support](https://support.wyzant.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005841543-Contact-Us) if you have any concerns we can help address.
