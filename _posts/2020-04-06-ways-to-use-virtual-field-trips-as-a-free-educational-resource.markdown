Where do field trips stand with school closings and closings of most public places? With teachers converting classes to online formats and parents cramming to figure out how to homeschool, they probably aren’t a priority. They don’t have to be out of the question entirely. With the magic of the internet and virtual reality, field trips can be a fun, enriching part of an at-home learning strategy that includes lessons, learning through play, and tutoring. 

## What is a Virtual Field Trip? 

Virtual field trips have been in some families’ arsenals of homeschooling activities as long as the internet as we know it has existed. The term can mean a few different things. Some include guided tours, others use VR to give the illusion of actually being present. Others are merely educational videos.

## Using virtual field trips as an education tool

No matter which type of online tour you’re doing, supplementing them with your own activities can bring home the connection to what they’re learning. Many sites have a tab for educational activities and teaching tools, but others do not.

For example: a virtual zoo field trip is a great idea for young students learning about animals. Though simply playing the video is great if you need productive ideas on how to keep kids busy, it may have limited educational value. The trip could help with spelling by asking your student to write down the names of all the animals they saw, or with math by asking for a total of big cats and bears.

A virtual museum field trip is an obvious choice for older students learning about art history, but the suggested activities could make it beneficial for younger children as well. 

Consider the information you have about what subjects your student is learning, concepts that need reinforcing, and their education goals to find creative ways to use virtual field trips as a fun and educational time. Here are a few ideas:

### Create a Presentation

Assigning a creative presentation is a great way to encourage your children to reflect on what they learned from the virtual trip, what they liked best, and what they would like to learn more about. Invite your kids to be creative and use what they like to do. If your child likes acting, they could perform a skit. If your child likes art, they could incorporate drawing or making a diorama. If your child likes creative writing, it could take the form of a short story. 

### Write a postcard

Having your child create a postcard from the place they visited is a creative, fun twist on the often-assigned written report or essay about a field trip. Simply have them draw a picture on one side of a large index card and write a message on the other side. 

### Scavenger hunt

Go through the virtual trip yourself before the kids do and take note of any interesting landmarks you find. Then, challenge the kids to find each item on the list. If you have multiple children, a little friendly competition could sweeten the deal. This could also be a fun way to compete/collaborate virtually with your child’s peers. 

## Virtual field trip ideas

Several sites of historic, cultural, and scientific significance had webcams and virtual field trip programs to begin with, but many others have created new ones after closing to visitors for the crisis. The options are not limited to museums and zoos. Virtual field trips can take you and your family to a national park, international destinations, and even outer space. Browse this list by category as a starting point.
