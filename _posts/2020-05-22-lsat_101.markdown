The Basics
Understand the LSAT Scoring System
To better understand the LSATs and how to prepare for them, it’s crucial that you understand how LSAT scoring works. This will give you a better idea of how many questions you need to answer correctly to get your ideal score. This is where it gets a bit tricky because the raw score from your test answers get converted to a scaled score. 

The Law School Admission Council provides a chart that helps you get a better idea of this raw score to scaled score conversion. Use this chart to find out what raw score you need to shoot for if you want to get great LSAT results.
Learn How to Study for the LSAT
Getting a good LSAT score isn’t so much diving blindly into your LSAT prep as learning how to study for the LSAT in a more strategic manner. It’s not enough that you know all the answers to the questions in your test; you should also work fast enough to finish answering them. That means you should learn the LSAT 101 on how to study smart and improve your speed.

Strategic LSAT prep helps you make sure that all the time and energy you spend on studying isn’t for nothing. It involves knowing which aspects of the test to focus on, maintaining a study schedule, learning testing methods to improve your speed, and more. It goes without saying that you’ll need to practice a lot, so your online LSAT prep should also include knowing where to get LSAT practice tests.

Logical Reasoning
Understand the Basic Strategies to Tackle Logical Reasoning
Among all the LSAT test sections, logical reasoning takes center stage and accounts for half of your total score. You get two types of logical reasoning questions - the regular logical reasoning questions that involve using nuances in language to deduce the right answer and the analytical reasoning questions involving logic games.

With questions designed to confuse you, tackling this section of the LSATs can take up a lot of your time. As such, it’s crucial that you focus your efforts on understanding the basic strategies to answer logical reasoning questions without spending too much time on them. Learning the do’s and don’ts of tackling this section of the test will help you avoid costly mistakes and improve your overall LSAT scores.
Practice Using Logic Games and Tests
As important as it is to learn the basic methods for tackling logical reasoning questions, it’s also important that you spend a lot of time putting those methods into practice. Use logic games to test your skills and improve how quickly you analyze the situation to come up with the right answer.

Additionally, you can also find practice tests for the common types of logical reasoning questions that often come up in the LSATs. Practicing on these tests will help you speed up your ability to deduce the issue being presented based on the specific language being used in the question. So you’ll have a better understanding of what to expect on the actual test and how to answer them without wasting all your allotted time.

Reading Comprehension
Discover Strategies to Improve Reading Comprehension
Believe it or not, there are strategies to improve how quickly you comprehend a given passage and derive correct answers from it. The LSAT reading comprehension test can take up a lot of your time as it involves reading a block of passage and using your understanding of the information to answer the given questions.

To work faster on these questions, you’ll need to learn how to standardize your reading process and better understand the text. You might even need to take a different approach based on the type of question you’re getting. So it’s crucial that you learn the strategies to improve your reading comprehension and better prep for the LSATs.

Brush Up on Your Skills Using Practice Passages
Just like with other sections of the LSATs, your reading comprehension needs practice. The more you practice reading passages and answering the given questions, the better you’ll get at processing the most crucial parts of the text. Use reading comprehension practice questions and test passages to get better at this part of the LSATs.

Writing
Understand How LSAT Writing Works
Although the essay section won’t have an effect on your overall LSAT scores, that doesn’t make it any less important. In fact, it could be the determining factor for whether or not you get into your dream school because it will be a part of your official report. So you could end up not getting into Harvard because of a poorly-written paper, although you scored a 179 in the test.

This makes it crucial that you spend an equal amount of time and effort into improving your LSAT writing. Have a clear idea of how this section of the test works so you understand what you need to do and how you can write a compelling paper.
Improve Your Writing Skills
It takes a lot of practice to improve your writing skills. It also requires understanding of the best practices that can help you become a better writer. This will help you learn how to tell a compelling story and make a strong point through your paper, which will then improve your chances of getting into your dream school.

So LSAT 101 involves thorough writing practice in addition to practicing other sections of the test that get scored.

Getting Help
Consider Working with an LSAT Tutor
Whether it’s your first time taking the LSATs or you’ve taken them a few times before, working with a dedicated tutor can guarantee better LSAT results. As you probably know by now, there’s a lot involved in the LSATs and it’s not enough to just study blindly. Otherwise, you could end up taking the test knowing a lot of things but being unable to apply that knowledge fast enough.

An LSAT tutor will provide you with personalized guidance on how to improve your test-taking skills, what to expect, how to improve your speed, and more. They will provide dedicated sessions to understand how each section of the test works, why it’s important, and how you should prepare for it.

However, that may not be enough to help you write a compelling paper. To stand a better chance of getting into your dream school, consider working with a dedicated tutor who can help you brush up on your writing skills as well.
