Finding a tutor to support you in your learning goals is invaluable. But, if you’ve never worked with a tutor before, or have only had mediocre experiences with tutoring, it can seem daunting.

Fortunately, there’s an easy way for you to determine whether a prospective tutor will be a good match because all [successful tutoring relationships](http://www.edutopia.org/blog/what-makes-a-successful-tutor-seth-linden) have similar qualities. Here are some of the best ways a great instructor will set themselves apart: 

## 1. They build a great working relationship with you.
A good tutor will want to understand your learning style. Figuring out what your goals are, what makes you tick and how you solve problems will not only help them tailor their teaching approach, it will create a bond of trust that lends to an [ideal environment for motivation and learning](http://www.apa.org/education/k12/relationships.aspx).

A teacher in a classroom is responsible for meeting the needs of many students at once, but a 1-to-1 tutor can organize their teaching method entirely around you. The more they know about you—your strengths, weaknesses and how you thrive—the better they can design their lessons and exercises to engage you as a learner. 

## 2. They communicate their plans early and often.
