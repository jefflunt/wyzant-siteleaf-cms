The worlds of startups and higher education could hardly be more different. In education, change tends to come slowly, after layers of approval and copious evidence. In startups, we tend to err on the side of moving fast and breaking things, as Mark Zuckerberg [famously pointed out]( https://www.geek.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-says-you-need-to-move-fast-and-break-things-922432/).

As the founder of an education-focused startup that is now a mature ed-tech business providing services to higher ed, I have one foot in each world – and I think they have a lot to learn from each other. Here, I’ll highlight four strategies familiar to startups that can help colleges and universities improve retention rates (and don’t worry – all four have been tested in the real world).

## 1: Create a Culture of Measurement Using Data and Analytics

The obsessive analytics culture in so many of today’s startups springs from an economic reality: startups have less money to spend than their established competitors, so they have to measure religiously to figure out where they can achieve ROI and how they can keep improving.

By now, most colleges and universities also have access to “big data,” which they gather from students. This includes information on background, engagement, and performance. And while data is an incredibly valuable resource (it’s even been called “[the new oil](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data)”), its value lies in its application. 

From what I’ve seen in the space, universities are only scratching the surface of what their data can unlock for them. Ironically, academic institutions almost all teach courses in statistics, science, economics, and computer science, but instead of leaning on data, technology, and the scientific method to make decisions, they rely on bureaucratic processes like RFPs and decision-by-committee. 

Hypothesis testing, data-driven decision making, and automation could have a material impact on things like college retention rates. This isn’t pure theory, either: many colleges [have seen success](https://edscoop.com/university-retention-is-falling-but-data-interventions-can-help/). Consider the examples of University of Nevada, Las Vegas and Georgia State University:

* UNLV knew that fully half of the 1,200 students enrolled in its intro to anatomy and physiology class each year failed. An educational psychology professor devised a system that tracked students’ engagement with digitized learning materials and **intervened when that activity showed signs of struggling** – before students performed poorly on tests. In the system’s pilot, a third of students who received interventions [performed better than they were otherwise expected to](https://edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2017/08/colleges-embrace-data-analytics-improve-student-retention).
* Georgia State University (which is doing a lot of cool things with retention rates, actually –  more below) used [more than two million historic grades](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/09/georgia-state-improved-its-graduation-rate-by-22-points-in-10-years/279909/) to create a predictive model of how students would likely perform in future classes based on current performance. The program now pings advisers (who are responsible for more than 300 students each) whenever a student behaves in a way that might jeopardize graduation – not registering for a major-required class, for instance. **Advisers can reach out to students proactively**, making it more likely that those who need help get it. Combined with other efforts, this has helped GSU improve its retention rates by 22 points in a decade.

What these efforts share is proactive intervention: using data to learn the factors that put students at risk of dropping out, then crafting interventions for when those risk factors arise. One of the most successful interactions is pairing an at-risk student with an experienced tutor who not only knows the subject material but can also relate to the student on a personal level. This is the service that Wyzant provides to universities, and we’ve been able to move course completion rates by 20 percentage points in certain cases. 

## 2: Use AI to Engage Students

Artificial intelligence chatbots are becoming [increasingly popular among startups](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-chatbot-landscape-shifts-again-in-2019-1faeba21ea1c) who use them to engage, interact with, and support both prospective and existing customers at scale.

Colleges and universities can also enjoy the economic advantages of AI, as Georgia State University showed when it used the chatbot Pounce to engage with students at risk of “summer melt” – getting accepted but not matriculating in the fall.

Students who received Pounce messaging enrolled at “[significantly higher rates](https://www.brookings.edu/interactives/5-ways-to-boost-community-college-completion-rates/)” than those who didn’t. Ultimately, Pounce reduced GSU’s summer melt by 21 percent, which is similar to what other outreach methods accomplished. Notably, though, Pounce was less expensive and less resource-intensive than other methods. 

This is an intriguing finding, suggesting that colleges might be able to use low-cost reminder technology like chatbots for initial outreach to improve student engagement and retention without significantly increasing the burden on advisers.

## 3: Tap into the Gig Economy to Supplement the Work of Professors and TAs

Startups have made it easier than ever for businesses and individuals to hire gig workers for tasks of all sizes. Thanks to companies like Upwork, Uber, and Airbnb, most people with a smartphone or an internet connection have participated in or benefitted from the gig economy in recent years by enjoying greater convenience, better prices, or both.

Colleges and universities could do the same.

For example, we’ve known for decades that [one-on-one tutoring is the most effective teaching method](http://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf). But the reality of student-to-teacher ratios prevents most professors – and even TAs – from offering one-on-one instruction on any kind of regular basis.

Still, such instruction could make a material difference for students struggling with course material. Colleges and universities could tackle this issue by following the lead of countless startups and tapping into tutors who work as part of the gig economy via platforms like Wyzant.

* Tutors from outside the university offer several advantages:
Students can receive more than the 15-minute block of dedicated time professors can typically afford to spare. While 15 minutes is sufficient to answer quick questions, it’s not enough for students with substantial learning gaps or those who completely miss a concept.
* Professors aren’t burdened with filling learning gaps students have from prerequisite courses.
* Students who need it get access to one-on-one learning – something few (if any) universities have the resources to offer via faculty and staff.
* Because tutoring platforms can connect tutors and learners online, students can access tutoring resources when it suits their schedule, rather than when it works for a professor.

That last item is particularly compelling for “post-traditional” students, who often have jobs and / or kids and who now make up the [majority of students enrolled in college](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/09/04/638561407/todays-college-students-arent-who-you-think-they-are).

In a [pilot program](https://edscoop.com/university-retention-is-falling-but-data-interventions-can-help/) with a major online not-for-profit university, students who received Wyzant tutoring in addition to attending office hours had course completion rates of 89.3 percent, compared to about 70 percent for those who either only received tutoring or only attended office hours.

## 4: Leverage the Power of Agile Development

I mentioned above that educational institutions tend to spend lots of time researching before making changes. Many startups today operate in exactly the opposite way, iterating quickly, learning from how their products behave “in the wild,” and adjusting. Tech companies refer to this as being “agile.” It involves making small, frequent changes fueled by ongoing data collection. 

Colleges can tap into the agile mindset as they implement efforts to improve retention rates. [New Jersey’s Ramapo College did just that](https://er.educause.edu/blogs/2017/8/ramapo-college-boosting-retention-rates-with-inclusive-student-services) when it launched new services aimed at raising retention rates for transfer students: instead of spending months brainstorming the perfect solution, the college started small, with tactics that already worked for existing students.

By taking this kind of iterative approach, Ramapo raised transfer retention rates from 78 percent to nearly 85 percent in four years.

## For Better Retention Rates, Start with Proof

What’s encouraging about these startup strategies is that colleges and universities have already tested them and proven them viable for improving retention. As [retention rates continue to fall](http://nscresearchcenter.org/currenttermenrollmentestimate-spring2018/), these road-tested techniques can prove essential to improving educational and financial outcomes.
