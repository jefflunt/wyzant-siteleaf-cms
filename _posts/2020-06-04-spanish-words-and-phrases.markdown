Spanish is the second largest language in the United States. Many students are looking for different ways to learn it than simply traditional methods. They're in luck - learning Spanish online, or through personalized lessons, is one of the most practical methods for picking up the language.

First-time students of Spanish seem to be interested in a simple question: how to learn Spanish faster. One way to begin is by learning basic Spanish phrases and words. As a beginner, you're likely interested in learning easy phrases to introduce yourself, ask questions, order food, or travel.

To begin, though, it's essential to understand basics about how to speak and write in Spanish. For that, let's first look at general information on Spanish pronunciation, accents and accent marks, and some Spanish grammar rules.

## Pronunciation

Generally, in a word in Spanish, each vowel and each consonant are almost often pronounced.

Their pronunciation varies according to some Spanish dialects. In Spain, for example, the consonant c is pronounced like” th” of thanks. That pronunciation occurs when the consonant c is accompanied by the vowels “e” and “i.”

However, the same consonant is pronounced as “s” in Latin America. Also, the z is pronounced like “th” of thief in Spain. But the same consonant is pronounced like “s” in Latin American.

The consonant ll is pronounced like the y as in yellow in most countries of Latin America, but in Argentina and Uruguay is pronounced like the sound “sh” of the word shoe in English.
Other sounds are pronounced differently than in English. The consonant "h" is silent, so it is never uttered. The "j" is pronounced similar to the "h" in hello. The "ñ" is stronger than an n and sounds closer to a “ny” sound.

The "r" is a soft vibration, and the "rr" is a rough vibration using the tongue.

Last but not least, the "q" (like in queso) is pronounced like the "c" of “cat.” The "u" following the "q" is always silent. So, the word *que*, which means "what" in English, is pronounced keh. 

One best way to learn Spanish is by practicing these sounds. You will feel more comfortable using them regularly, and your pronunciation will be refined.

## Accents
Accents are important to stress words correctly. For example, the word intelligent in English is stressed in the syllable “te.” In contrast, the word in Spanish *inteligente* is emphasized in the syllable “gen.” 

Another example is the word ac-ti-vi-ty. In English, it is stressed on the second syllable “ti.” In contrast, *actividad* (activity) in Spanish is emphasized in the last syllable: ac-ti vi-**dad**.

A good number of words in Spanish have stronger stress in one syllable. There are other words, though, that don’t have stress in **any** syllable. Most of them are monosyllables like articles *el, la, los, las* (the) and possessives *mi, su, tu, sus* (my, your, his, hers).

## Spanish accent marks
In Spanish, accent marks are essential. More often, an accent (or lack of it) completely changes the meaning of a word.

A good example is *llamo* (present tense for "I call") and *llamó* (preterite tense for "he/she called").

Spanish uses three types of accent marks: the **dieresis (ü)**, the **virgulilla (ñ)**, and the **acute accent (é)**.

### Dieresis
The *dieresis* (ü) is used on top of the vowel "u" after the letter "g" in certain words to request that the "u" must be pronounced.

An example: *cigüeña* (stork).

### Virgulilla
The virgulilla (ñ) is only used on top of the letter "n". When we see a word with a virgulilla it suggests to pronounce the n more strongly. The sound is like a “ny” sound. For example, año (year), niño, (boy), and baño (bathroom).

## Acute accent

The acute accent is the most common accent mark in the Spanish language. It can appear above all five vowels: á, é, í, ó, ú. At most, it appears once per word.

Generally, an acute accent is used to denote word stress. For example, the word *canción* (song) has a sharp emphasis on the vowel "ó". This suggests stressing more on the last syllable of *can-ción*.

Most words in Spanish have an accent, but not all words have acute accents. Just remember: when you see a word with an acute accent, the stress will be stronger in that syllable. 

## Some Spanish grammar rules
**Verbs** in Spanish conjugate differently according to personal pronouns and tenses.

For example, the verb "to have" is *tener*. In the present tense, it conjugates as *yo tengo* (I have), but it conjugates as *tú tienes* for "you have".

**Nouns** in Spanish have gender - they are either feminine or masculine. Consequently, they must be used with articles and adjectives that match their gender.

When nouns become plural, the articles and adjectives also adapt to the sentence accordingly. For example, *la mesa roja*, or "the red table". Mesa is feminine, so the article *la* is used, and the color *rojo* is adjusted to feminine (replacing an "a" with an "o" at the end).

Here's another example. The phrase *los restaurantes nuevos* means "the new restaurants". *Restaurantes* is a masculine word and, in this case, is plural. The article *los* is adjusting to the noun being masculine and plural. Also, the letter "s" is added at the end of the adjective *nuevos* to match the noun *restaurantes*. 

## Useful Spanish words and phrases
Now that you've got a better comprehension of how to speak and read in the language, we will look at some easy to learn and important words and phrases in Spanish.

### Greetings
The most popular Spanish greetings are *hola* and *adiós*. They are used to say "hello" and "goodbye".

*Hola* is generally used between friends, family, and people you already know. In a more formal setting, like in the airport, or with someone you've just met, other greetings are more appropriate, like *buenos días* (good morning), *buenas tardes* (good afternoon), or *buenas noches* (good evening).

* *Hola*- “Hello”
* *Buenos Días* – Good morning
* *Buenas Tardes* – Good afternoon
* *Buenas Noches* – Good evening
* *Adiós* – Goodbye, bye
* *Chao* – Goodbye, bye
* *Hasta mañana* – See you tomorrow
* *Nos vemos* – See you

### Introducing yourself and starting a conversation
*¿Cómo te llamas?* or *¿Cuál es tu nombre?* are questions used to ask "what is your name?" To reply, you can say *me llamo* (literally "I am called"), or *mi nombre es* (my name is).

If you are in a formal setting or speaking with someone you just met for the first time, the questions change slightly to *¿Como se llama?* or *¿Cuál es su nombre?* 

*¿Cómo estás?* is used to ask "how are you?" in an informal setting. *¿Cómo está?* without the "s" is used in formal settings and with people you don’t know.

There is also *¿Qué onda?* or *¿Qué cuentas?* They mean "what’s up?" and "what’s new?". Both are used in casual and informal situations, only with close friends and family. 

*¿Qué tal?* is a very general Spanish greeting. You can use it with everyone regardless of their age and how well you know them. It works just like *¿Cómo estás?* This could be helpful when travelling, meeting new people or even in your first Spanish tutoring class. 

Here are some ways to greet someone and introduce yourself in Spanish:

* *¿Cómo te llamas?* – What is your name? (informal)
* *¿Cómo se llama?* – What is your name? (formal)

*Gracias* is the most popular way to say "thank you" in Spanish. It works in any setting. There are other variations as well, like *muchas gracias* and *muchísimas gracias*. Both mean "thank you very much."

*Por favor* is used to say "please" and *de nada* to say "you're welcome."

* *Gracias* - Thank you
* *Muchas gracias* - Thank you very much
* *Muchísimas gracias* -Thank you very much
* *Por favor* - please
* *De nada* - Your welcome
* *Es un placer* - It is a pleasure
* *Con mucho gusto* - It is a pleasure

### Asking around for help
If you ever encounter a problem when you are on a trip, getting information, or shopping, the following phrases should be helpful. Since you are going to talk to strangers, then keeping the grammar in formal mode is advisable. 

* *¿Puede ayudarme, por favor?* - Can you help me, please?
* *¿Habla inglés?* – Do you speak English?
* *¿Cuánto es?* or *Cuánto cuesta?* - How much is it?
* *¿Dónde está?* – Where is?

* *¿Hay un banco cerca?* - Is there a bank nearby?
* *¿Cómo llego al aeropuerto?* - How do I get to the airport?
* *¿Cómo llego al museo?* - How do I get to the museum?

### Asking questions
When learning the Spanish language, knowing the first words to start formulating questions will help you organize your sentences.
*¿Qué?* is the most popular term for "what?". You might use it to ask about anything in general.

*¿Cuál?* is also used for *que* but mainly means "which", as it suggests picking one of a group.

*¿Por qué?* spelled separated is "why", and *porque* spelled together is "because".

* *¿Qué?* – What?
* *¿Cuál?* – What? which?
* *¿Cómo?* – How?
* *¿Por qué?* – Why?
* *Porque - Because
* *¿Qué es esto?* - What is this?

### Making polite commands and small requests
Whether you are traveling, ordering food, meeting new people, or in your [first Spanish lesson](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/online-spanish-lessons/), these phrases will help you make small requests.

* *Tengo una pregunta* - I have a question
* *¿Cómo se dice?* – How do you say...?
* *¿Qué es...?* – What is...?
* *Repita por favor* – Repeat, please
* *No entiendo* – I don’t understand
* *No sé* – I don’t know

* *Hable más despacio por favor* - Speak slower, please

* *Necesito ayuda, por favor* – I need help, please

### Apologizing

*Disculpe* means "excuse me" when you want to ask a question to a stranger, as in, "*¿Disculpe, dónde está el banco?* which means, "Excuse me, where is the bank?" It also means "excuse me" if you are giving forewarning: *Disculpe, voy a pasar* (excuse me, I am passing through).

*Perdón* is used to say "I am sorry" if you bump into someone. *Lo siento* does mean "I am sorry", but is usually used to say, "I am sorry for you."

* *Disculpe* - Excuse me
* *Perdón, perdóneme* – Excuse me, I am sorry (if you bump into someone)
* *Disculpe, disculpeme* – Excuse me (giving forewarning)
* *Lo siento or lo lamento* - I am sorry, or I am sorry for you (for expressing sympathy)

## Ordering food in Spanish
*Quiero* literally means "I want", but unlike English, *quiero* is polite in Spanish; *me gustaría* is the literal translation of "I would like."

However, you don’t really use it when ordering food. 

If you are ordering something to drink for yourself, you'll say, “Quiero un vaso de agua, por favor* (I want a glass of water, please)." Adding the word *por favor* (please) at the end will express politeness.

If you are with a group of people and you would like to order for each of you, then *para mí* (for me) can be used to order for yourself, *para él* (to order for a male), *para ella* (to order for a female). For example, *"Para mí, un jugo de naranja, para él una cerveza y para ella un café con leche," literally translated means, "For me, orange juice, for him a beer, and for her, a latte."

When asking for a glass of wine, we say Quiero una copa de vino. Vaso is generally the word for glass. But copa is used only when drinking wine. Red wine is vino tinto and not vino rojo. White wine is vino blanco.

When asking for the check is la cuenta, por favor. Instead of saying I would like the check please, we just go straight to "the check, please." 

Here are more useful words that will help you practice Spanish when ordering food.

* Quiero - I want, I would like 
* Quiero un jugo de naranja, por favor – I want orange juice, please
* Quiero un café (con leche), por favor – I want a latte, please
* Quiero una cerveza, por favor- I want a beer, please
* Quiero una copa de vino, por favor - I want a glass of wine, please 
* Quiero una copa de vino tinto, por favor – I want a glass of red wine, please
* Quiero una copa de vino blanco, por favor – I want a glass of white wine, please.
* Quiero tacos de carne, por favor. – I want beef tacos, please
* ¿Tienes mantequilla? – Do you have butter?
* La cuenta por favor – The check. please
* ¿Cuánto es? – How much is it?
