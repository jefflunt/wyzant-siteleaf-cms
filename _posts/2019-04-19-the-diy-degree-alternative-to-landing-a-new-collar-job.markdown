For more than a decade now, landing a tech job has been a more or less surefire path to economic security. Chalk that up to the laws of supply and demand: there’s an estimated [STEM skills gap in the United States](https://research.newamericaneconomy.org/report/sizing-up-the-gap-in-our-supply-of-stem-workers/) of three million people, or about 16 STEM jobs posted for every unemployed person with the appropriate qualifications.

The shortage has led to a proliferation of what IBM CEO Ginni Rometty has coined “new collar jobs:” jobs that require employees to have a specific skill set rather than a certain degree.

Her [2016 open letter](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/ibm-ceo-ginni-romettys-letter-u-s-president-elect/) to president-elect Donald Trump laid out her case: update our educational system to reflect the needs of the job market. Rometty and IBM have pioneered a model six-year high school that combines elements of community colleges, mentoring, and real-world job experience designed to prepare students for work in cybersecurity, data science, AI, and “cognitive business.”

The vision is exciting – but because only a few of these schools currently exist, it’s out of reach for most Americans. Luckily, there’s an alternative path to preparing for a new-collar job. 

## New-Collar Education: Focus on Employment

One common criticism of the traditional four-year college education is that it isn’t necessarily career-oriented. Most students aren’t even required to declare a major until their third or fourth semester. While that may allow students to explore many areas of study and follow their interests, it’s an expensive path to follow in today’s era of ever-increasing college tuition.

For those looking to train for a specific job, the educational path is much more straightforward: identify the skills necessary to perform the job, learn those skills, and apply for the job.

This is even more beautifully simple in the era of new-collar jobs, when employers are open to considering those who don’t have traditional four-year degrees. If you’re interested in landing one of these new-collar jobs, I recommend considering the following:

* **Understand the new-collar market where you live.** Smaller cities and those that aren’t known for their tech scene tend to be [hubs for new-collar employment](https://www.marketplace.org/2018/02/07/business/no-degree-required-more-tech-employers-looking-skills-rather-diploma). That’s because known tech centers like Silicon Valley tend to attract highly qualified (and highly educated) STEM workers from around the world. Employers in those hubs can afford to require a degree. Demand for qualified workers is much higher in smaller cities, and supply is lower. This makes them an excellent place to seek new-collar employment.

* **Review job requirements for relevant positions.** Before you put together your new-collar curriculum, spend time reading job postings in your area. Are there certain coding languages that are in high demand, for example? Are any employers explicitly stating whether or not a four-year degree is required? Having a sense of what’s needed can help you know where to focus your learning efforts.

* **Talk with a recruiter.** Before you set out on a journey to learn Ruby, for example, talk with some STEM recruiters in your town. Get a sense from them which skills are essential on day one and which ones employers are happy to teach on the job. 

Once you have a sense of what you’ll need to learn to land a new-collar job near you, it’s time to hit the (virtual) books.

## Work with Tutors to Master Relevant New-Collar Skills

Because new-collar jobs by definition don’t require a college degree, gaining the necessary qualifications for these jobs doesn’t require going to college. That’s good news, given that the [average yearly cost of college](https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/average-published-undergraduate-charges-sector-2018-19) (including tuition, fees, room, and board) is…

* $12,320 at a public, two-year institution if you’re in district.
* $21,379 at a public, four-year institution if you’re in state.
* $37,430 at a public, four-year institution if you’re out of state.
* $48,510 at a private, nonprofit, four-year institution.

By working with individual tutors, you can develop the skills necessary for a new-new collar job for a fraction of that price. Here’s a back-of-the envelope sketch of what you might pay.

Let’s say you want to learn the coding language Java and you’re giving yourself six months to do so. To become proficient for an entry-level position in that time, let’s assume you’ll need two hour-long tutoring sessions per week, which you’ll supplement with daily practice.

The average cost of a Java tutor on Wyzant is about [$60 per hour.](https://www.wyzant.com/Java_tutors.aspx) Two hours per week for 26 weeks (six months) comes to $3,120 – far less than a college degree. It’s also far less than the [average coding bootcamp](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2018-coding-bootcamp-market-size-research), which clocks in at $11,900 and requires participants to attend full time (meaning it’s difficult to attend while working).

Working with a one-on-one tutor – or a couple of tutors – can have significant benefits for those looking to learn a marketable skill:

* One-on-one instruction has long been accepted as [the most effective way to learn a new skill](http://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf). 
* Because many tutors also work as coding professionals, they can offer guidance on practical, real-world problems that come up in the workplace.
* Unlike college courses or coding bootcamps, tutoring (especially online tutoring) is flexible, meaning busy learners can make time for it within their existing schedule.

## Turning New Skills into a New-Collar Job

As with any type of education, the key to translating tutoring sessions into work-ready skills is practicing. While the structure of coding bootcamps forces learners to practice for several hours per day, the tutoring route does not – which means it may require more discipline for those who choose this path.

While there’s no one-size-fits-all way to get adequate practice in, experts suggest that mastery requires more than an hour per day of work. Sure, that’s a big commitment, but probably more attainable than it seems, given that the average US adult currently spends about [five hours per day watching TV](https://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/reports-downloads/2019-reports/q3-2018-total-audience-report.pdf).
