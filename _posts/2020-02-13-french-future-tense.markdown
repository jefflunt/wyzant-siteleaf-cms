Let’s talk about the future! There are three main ways to express the future tense in French: *futur proche, futur simple*, and *futur anterieur*. Each one has different rules and purposes. 

Prior knowledge of the [French present tense](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/french-verbs-present-tense/) and infinitives is enormously helpful when learning future tense conjugations, as is knowledge of the [past tense](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/french-past-tense/), particularly *passé composé*. 

## Futur Proche

*Futur proche*, or the French near future, is the literal equivalent of saying, in English, “I am going to ______.” The statement has two parts: the “going”, which is the appropriate present tense conjugation of *aller*, and the infinitive of the main verb. 

To review: here are the present tense conjugations for *aller*:

### Aller (to go) - present tense

* Je vais
* Tu vas
* Il/Elle/On va
* Nous allons
* Vous allez
* Ils/Elles vont

And here is the full *futur proche* conjugation of *marcher*:

### Marcher (to walk) - near future tense

* Je vais marcher
* Tu vas marcher
* Il/Elle/On va marcher
* Nous allons marcher
* Vous allez marcher
* Ils/Elles vont marcher

## Negation in Futur Proche

To negate a *future proche* statement, place the *ne, pas* around the *aller*.
That makes “I am not going to drive” into *"Je ne vais pas conduire"*, or “You are not going to sing” into *“Tu ne vas pas chanter”.*

## Futur Simple

*Futur simple* is closer to “I will ___”, except it's expressed in two words instead of three. You cannot simply say “I will” in French. You will what...? The word "will” is part of the conjugation. Native francophones use *futur proche* more frequently than English speakers use its equivalent. That leaves *futur simple* reserved for big picture statements, hypotheticals, and things that will likely happen in the future, but are not currently in the process of happening (i.e. “I will get married one day” or “I will go to law school one day"). *Futur simple* can also be used to express probability or likelihood, especially with *avoir* and *être*. 

Unlike most French verb conjugations, *futur simple* does not chop the last two letters off the infinitive before conjugating. For “-ir” and “-er” verbs, the endings are added directly to the infinitive. For “-re” verbs, you chop off only the “-e” but keep the “-r”. This also applies to conditional endings.

The endings are the same as they are for *être*. This rule applies to most conjugations, except for - you guessed it - *nous* and *vous*.

### Parler (to speak) - future tense

* Je parlerai
* Tu parleras
* Il/Elle/On parlera
* Nous parlerons
* Vous parlerez
* Ils/Elles parleront

Pronunciation note: the “e” before the “r” is unvoiced in the futur simple conjugation. That means *parlerai* is pronounced “parl-RAY”, *parlera* is pronounced “parl-RAH”, *parlerons* is pronounced “parl-ROHN”, *parlerez* is also pronounced “parl-RAY”, and *parleront* is pronounced “parl-RON”.

### Finir (to finish) 

* Je finirai
* Tu finiras
* Il/Elle/On finira
* Nous finirons
* Vous finirez
* Ils/Elles finiront

### Descendre (to go downward) 

* Je descendrai
* Tu descendras
* Il/Elle/On descendra
* Nous descendrons
* Vous descendrez 
* Ils/Elles descendront

## Irregular Futur Simple Stems 

*Futur simple* has quite a few irregular stems. French is like English, in that grammar "rules" usually come with strings attached.

Here's a few you should know: 

* Aller (to go): ir-
* Apercevoir (to notice): apercevr-
* Asseoir (to sit): assoir-
* Avoir (to have): aur-
* Courir (to run): courr-
* Cueillir (to pick): cueiller-
* Devoir (to have to): devr-
* Envoyer (to send): enverr-
* Être (to be): ser-
* Faire (to make, to do): fer-
* Falloir (to be necessary): faur-
* Mourir (to die): mourr-
* Pleuvoir (to rain): pleuvr-
* Pouvoir (to be able to): pourr-
* Recevoir (to receive): recevr-
* Savoir (to know): saur-
* Tenir (to hold): tiendr-
* Valoir (to be worth): vaudr-
* Venir (to come): viendr-
* Voir (to see): verr-
* Vouloir (to want): voudr- 

These still have the same endings as regular verbs. Here are two examples that are the most common. For the rest, you apply the pattern!

### Avoir 

* J’aurai
* Tu auras
* Il/Elle/On aura
* Nous aurons 
* Vous aurez 
* Ils/Elles auront

### Être

* Je serai
* Tu seras
* Il/Elle/On sera
* Nous serons
* Vous serez
* Ils/Elles seront

## Futur Antérieur

*Futur antérieur*, or future perfect, is the “I will have” future. It has two parts: the auxiliary and the main verb.

The auxiliary is either *avoir* or *être*, conjugated in *futur simple*, and the main verb is the thing the subject **will have done** as a past participle. This sort of makes it like a combination between *futur simple* and *passé composé*. 

There is a classic mnemonic device for French verbs that use *être* for both *futur antérieur* and *passé composé*: 

### DR. & MRS. VAN DER TRAMPP

**D**evenir (to come from)<br />
**R**evenir (to come back, to return)<br /><br />
&<br />
<br />
**M**onter (to go up, climb)<br />
**R**ester (to stay)<br />
**S**ortir (to go out)<br />
<br />
**V**enir (to come)<br />
**A**ller (to go)<br />
**N**aître (to be born)<br />
<br />
**D**escendre (to come down)<br />
**E**ntrer (to enter)<br />
**R**entrer (to return)<br />
<br />
**T**omber (to fall)<br />
**R**etourner (to return)<br />
**A**rriver (to arrive, to come)<br />
**M**ourir (to die)<br />
**P**artir (to leave)<br />
**P**asser (to pass [by])<br />

You may notice a theme: all of these verbs are related to coming and going, including the big coming and goings of birth and death.

For past participles, regular “-er” verbs end with “é”, regular “-ir” verbs end with “i”, and regular “-re” verbs end with “u”. 

### Notable irregular past participles
 
* Avoir: eu (had)
* Boire: bu (drank)
* Conduire: conduit (driven)
* Connaître: connu (known)
* Croire: cru (believed)
* Devoir: du (had)
* Dire: dit (said)
* Écrire: écrit (written)
* Être: été (been)
* Faire: fait (made, done)
* Lire: lu (read)
* Mettre: mis (put)
* Offrir: offrit (offered)
* Ouvrir: ouvert (opened)
* Pleuvoir: plu (rained)
* Pouvoir: pu (been able to)
* Prendre: pris (taken)
* Recevoir: reçu (received)
* Savoir: su (known)
* Voir: vu (seen)
* Vouloir: voulu (wanted)

Here are some examples:

### Manger (to eat)
 
* J’aurai mangé
* Tu auras mangé
* Il/Elle/On aura mangé
* Nous aurons mangé
* Vous aurez mangé
* Ils/Elles auront mangé
 
### Remplir (to fill)
 
* J’aurai rempli
* Tu auras rempli
* Il/Elle/On aura rempli
* Nous aurons rempli
* Vous aurez rempli
* Ils/Elles auront rempli
 
### Vendre (to sell) 
 
* J’aurai vendu
* Tu auras vendu
* Il/Elle/On aura vendu
* Nous aurons vendu
* Vous aurez vendu
* Ils/Elles auront vendu
 
### Aller (to go)
 
* Je serais allé
* Tu seras allé
* Il/Elle/On sera allé
* Nous serons allé

### Partir (to leave)

* Ils/Elles auront fait
 
### Être (to be)
 
* J’aurai été
* Tu auras été
* Il/Elle/On aura été
* Nous aurons été
* Ils/Elles auront été
 
## Negation of Futur Anterieur
 
To negate a *futur anterieur* statement, place the *ne, pas* around the auxiliary. Yes, this is like the negation for *futur proche*, and applies to every verb conjugation type that has two parts. 

This makes “I will not have gone” into *"Je n’aurai pas allé"*, and “You will not have seen” into *"Tu n’auras pas vu”*. 

## Using the Present Tense to Express the Future
 
There are some contexts in French when it is acceptable to use the present tense when talking about future events. If a sentence includes an indication of when the event **will** take place, the future is already implied, so a future tense conjugation is not necessary. 

Some examples of such indications include: *bientôt* (soon), *dans cinq minutes* (in five minutes), *dans une heure* (in an hour), *demain* (tomorrow), *l’an prochain* (next year), *le moi prochain* (next month), and *la semaine prochaine* (next week).

This makes sentences like *“J’arrive dans dix minutes”* ("I arrive in ten minutes") and *“Tu présents demain”* ("You present tomorrow") grammatically acceptable and correct. 

## Further Learning

When to use each type of future tense is, for the most part, logical. Like other French verb conjugations, becoming more fluent is a matter of memorization, noticing patterns, and **[practice, practice, practice](https://www.wyzant.com/French_tutors.aspx)**. The conjugation of *futur simple* is easier than others, so the challenging part will be memorizing irregular stems well enough to use them off the cuff. Stick to it!
