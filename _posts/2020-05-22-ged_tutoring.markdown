Let’s face it—adulthood is more complicated now than it has ever been. With the technological, economical, and societal landscapes changing right before our eyes, it’s no surprise that so many adults are seeking out additional education. For those who never graduated from high school, the GED® test can open up new occupational and academic opportunities amidst the shifting scene.

What is the GED? It’s a nationwide exam designed to determine high school equivalency as well as college and career readiness. Depending on your high school experience or how long it’s been since you attended high school, you may feel that getting your GED diploma is a daunting proposition. Thankfully, there are plenty of expert tutors out there that can guide you on the path to that diploma. As you enter that first tutoring lesson, you may be wondering what to expect as you embark on the preparation experience.

1. Understand the purpose of the GED®
What does GED stand for? Originally, the term was short for the Tests of General Educational Development, but since 2011 the company has just used the term GED. 
As the most recognizable of the high school equivalency tests, the GED® is used in 40 of the 50 states, although some of those states also accept the TASC™ (Test Assessing Secondary Completion) and/or the HiSET® (High School Equivalency Test). Three states use only the TASC™ (Indiana, New York, and West Virginia), while seven states use only the HiSET® (Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, and Tennessee).

The GED® includes the reading, writing, thinking, and problem-solving skills needed for postsecondary programs and for the workplace. This means that your high school equivalency diploma is not an end in itself—it’s the springboard to more education, to better-paying jobs, and to more rewarding career paths.

2. Gain an overview of the GED® as a whole
What is on the GED? The GED® test comprises four subjects: math, science, social studies, and language arts. Each subject exam tests a student’s knowledge of topics covered in a typical high school classroom, from history and government to life science and algebra. 

Overall, the GED® has a length of more than 7 hours, but you don’t have to take all four subject tests on the same day. In fact, it’s better to prepare for each subject test individually and then take them separately. During that preparation process, you’ll become familiar with all the question types in the GED®:

* Multiple-choice: Click to choose from four choices (A through D).
* Fill-in-the-blank: Type a word, a phrase, or numbers in a box.
* Drag-and-drop: Move words, numbers, or objects across the computer screen. 
* Drop-down: Select from menus embedded in text on the computer screen.
* Select-an-area: Click on graphics on the computer screen.
* Short-answer: Write a paragraph or two of explanation in response to passages and/or graphics.
* Extended response: Compose a well-developed and supported response to two passages.

Of course, you want to how to take the GED®, and you may even be asking about how to get your GED® online. Unfortunately, online testing is not currently an option according to the GED Testing Service®: “The GED test must be taken at a physical test center on a computer, where there is a proctor on site to monitor all test takers and ensure all protocol is followed.”
