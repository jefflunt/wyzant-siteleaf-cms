Are you still wondering about the benefits of online tutoring, or why students need tutoring in the first place? Here’s some food for thought: 

## Four studies have demonstrated how just eight hours of working with a private tutor can have such a dramatic effect on your child’s behavior and grades.

While letter grades are important (especially when we think about the increasingly competitive college application process), they rarely tell the whole story. They’re just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to private tutoring and one-on-one learning outcomes.
Private tutoring offers a customized learning plan tailored to the specific needs of each student while removing peer pressure from the equation. This not only helps students improve their grades but also enhances their overall learning experience. 

Still having doubts? Here’s the research:

## Finding 1: Eight weeks of tutoring reduces math anxiety by up to 20%

[Math anxiety](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150619-do-you-have-maths-anxiety) is a real and serious psychological condition that can inhibit a student’s ability to perform even the simplest arithmetic calculations. In fact, a math test can activate the pain matrix in your brain, which is the same region that lights up when you get injured. In more serious cases, even just the numbers on a receipt can send people into a panic.

The good news is that private tutoring can significantly alleviate this math anxiety. Researchers found that eight weeks of one-on-one tutoring helped kids become [20% less anxious about math](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/09/08/438592588/one-tutor-one-student-better-math-scores-less-fear). Students participating in the study received highly personalized tutoring where tutors used non-negative and encouraging techniques to help them tackle difficult concepts.

This kind of highly customized learning plan is exactly what you can get through online tutoring sessions. So if your kid struggles with math anxiety, you should consider working with affordable tutors to give them one-on-one lessons and minimize the anxiety.
The only question is – how much is private tutoring? Although it’s highly beneficial in helping kids with their learning anxieties, not everyone can cover the high cost that comes with hiring a private tutor to give one-on-one lessons. 

Fortunately, you have the option to find affordable tutors if you consider online tutoring. This helps you get the customized learning plan that your child needs without spending a fortune, as even the best tutoring service will provide affordable payment plans for online tutoring.

### Finding 2: When kids ask questions, they want answers (not attention)

Remember being afraid to raise your hand in front of the class for fear of feeling dumb? It wasn’t feeling dumb you were afraid of; it was the shame that came with it. What if you asked a silly question? What if everyone else understood it but you? Those questions might often hold you back from getting clarification on a difficult concept.

Unfortunately, no matter how intelligent or engaged a student is (or wants to be), social surroundings play a role. No one wants to feel like they know less than their peers and that embarrassment is especially prominent in kids.

So when they ask questions, they don’t want to feel the rest of the classroom’s attention directed towards them even though that’s not actually the case. This is known as the [spotlight effect](http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/self/spotlight-effect/) in psychology and refers to the tendency to overestimate how much people notice or judge your appearance and/or behavior.

Although the spotlight effect is common across people of all age groups, it’s more prominent in adolescents and young adults. This is likely because at this age, humans typically have a heightened concern for their social standing.

Instead of risking the attention from asking a question, they’ll choose to keep it to themselves even if it means struggling to understand certain concepts that they were to afraid to get clarifications for. 

As trivial as it might seem, those feelings can derail a student’s effort. More importantly, it can dampen the willingness to take chances. Here’s why that’s important:

* Children need to ask questions: When given the chance to ask questions, a child’s thinking ability can be surprising largely because they are more invested in finding an answer.

* Children need to make mistakes. Without them, children never learn to overcome failure. This makes all the difference between a fixed mindset versus a growth mindset.

Private tutoring gives them the freedom to work one-on-one with a tutor, which removes the fear of social humiliation. So they will be more inclined to ask questions and get the answers they need, ensuring a better understanding of the topic and a fulfilling learning experience.

The same goes for [different types of remote learning](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/types-of-remote-learning/) such as distance learning and online tutoring. Since students won’t come face to face with their classmates through these learning methods, there’s a lower risk for the spotlight effect to have an impact. So there’s a lower risk for embarrassment, which means students will feel less pressure when asking questions.

### Finding 3: Giving students choices increases their willingness to take on difficult tasks

While it might seem counter-intuitive, giving students a choice can improve their learning experience by increasing their attention span. 

A 2008 research at Duke University looked at 41 separate studies and found when children had a choice in what they worked on, they were more likely to take on tasks that were challenging. In addition, a child given the chance to learn something they enjoy has shown to result in a higher level of persistence and a greater dedication to completing the work at hand.

Students need variety – whether it’s in terms of where they study, the learning channel they use, the subjects being covered, or the amount of exercises they work on. Studies that go [as far back as 1978](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/views/07mind.html?pagewanted=2&_r=4) have shown that retention improves with flexible circumstances. Besides, learning new things can help children’s [brains to change](http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/jugg2.html).

So a restrictive learning environment inside a classroom can only do so much. Mixing it up with private tutoring lessons and [homeschooling](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/how-to-homeschool/) could help enhance their learning experience. 
Through online tutoring, kids automatically fall into a role where they become active participants in learning. It also gives them the ability to work at their own pace as well as choose topics and themes that become the vehicle for their learning. Plus, the abundance of [online learning tools](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/online-learning-tool-video/) gives them the freedom to experiment with tools that fit their learning styles.

### Finding 4: Students with involved parents are more likely to earn higher test scores and enroll in higher-level programs

As a parent, you’ve probably seen it. The more (or less) time you’ve spent helping your child or actively discussing school has had an effect. In fact, [research shows](https://www.waterford.org/education/how-parent-involvment-leads-to-student-success/) that when parents are engaged, their kids are more likely to earn higher grades and even enroll in higher level programs. 

Not only that, they develop more self-confidence in the classroom and feel more motivated to learn. As a result, they are less likely to struggle with low self-esteem or need redirection in the classroom.

What is it about parental involvement that does that? The easy answer is that parents help children succeed on the work itself. A less obvious outcome is the way it encourages positive school behaviors. Your child notices and learns from everything you do, including exhibiting values like organizing and being helpful. Those values are powerful and important parts of school success.
So it’s crucial that you [consider homeschooling](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/remote-learning-homeschool-faqs/) your kids beyond the education they get in a traditional classroom. But it can be challenging to be involved all the time, especially when you have multiple kids or work a demanding job. 

That’s where private tutoring services enter the picture, as they help give your kids the one-on-one attention they need to learn while enforcing the same positive values as you would if you’re personally involved. Besides, your own interaction with the tutor will help you play a significant role in your child’s learning.
In spite of this obvious benefit, you might have concerns about private tutoring cost and whether you can afford it. The good news is that you can find affordable tutors through online tutoring services to provide your kids with a customized learning plan without spending a fortune.
