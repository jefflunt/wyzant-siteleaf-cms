There are tons of advantages to online tutoring. It’s convenient, and geographical constraints are virtually irrelevant, so students and parents all over the world can find the exact right fit. Since demand for remote learning and homeschooling has vastly increased in the last few weeks, more tutors have taken their lessons online, opening up a world of choice with regard to the kind of expertise, experience, and rate that works best for your unique needs. 

Online tutoring, on average, is less expensive than in-person options (when [in-person IS an option](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/wyzant-covid-19-response-and-student-guidance/)), without sacrificing effectiveness. Both parties experience their lesson from a comfortable space, meaning no awkward social pressure, and what’s more: there’s never been a time where online education guidance is more crucial.
