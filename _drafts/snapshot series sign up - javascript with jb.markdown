**Snapshot Tutor JB**
My name is JB and I’ve been developing software for more than ten years—four of which I’ve been tutoring aspiring computer scientists, much like yourself.

Come get your feet wet, and your questions answered, in my free Intro to Java Snapshot Session. 

I’ll lay out where to begin, the basics of programs, and why it all matters—so you can decide if Java is the language for you.

Join me [DATE / TIME] for a thirty-minute snapshot of Java, followed by an open Q&A.
