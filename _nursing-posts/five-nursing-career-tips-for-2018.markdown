## Evaluate your current position

Whether you’re a RN or BSN,  a MSN or NP, a life in nursing means a life in ongoing education. As you begin 2018, consider your current level of happiness with your degree and certifications. If you’re interested in transitioning into a new role, this may be the year to start thinking about getting back to school.

Today's availability of accredited online programs makes obtaining a new degree and certifications easier than ever before, and if there are courses you’re dreading, consider finding a private tutor who can work with you and your busy schedule. The key to following through on your goals is pursuing them on your terms.

## Attend conferences

Conferences provide great opportunities to stay up to date on the latest trends in your field, and likewise enable you to expand your professional network beyond the scope of your current role. In many cases, your employer will cover the cost of traveling to and attending conferences under a professional development stipend. Not sure where to start? Here’s a list of [conferences]

## Learn a second language

Native Spanish speakers now account for just over 18% of the U.S. population. In fact, the U.S. currently has more Spanish speakers than Spain. In states where the Spanish-speaking population is densest, such as California, Texas, New York, Illinois, and Florida, knowing your patients’ native language can have significant implications on the caliber of care you’re able to provide. In light of this fact, many health care systems incentivize bilingualism with higher pay or bonuses.

Besides strengthening your resumé, learning a second language can benefit you in your personal life too. Studying a new language has been demonstrated to increase memory and attention span, boost creativity, and bolster self-confidence. If trying to learn on your own sounds a little daunting, finding a tutor may be a good idea. Working one-on-one with a private tutor online provides a great avenue for receiving personalized instruction, guidance, and feedback without having to leave home.

## Maintain an updated resume´

This one is a no-brainer. As soon as you obtain new continuing education credits or celebrate an anniversary at work, update your portfolio and career plan to reflect your most recent experience and qualifications. This way, you will always have an up-to-date resume´ on hand to submit to prospective employers as soon as new opportunities arise.

## Become a coach or mentor

Nursing isn’t a career–it’s a calling. The reason that so many employers require 3-5 years of patient care experience (and often more) is that a great deal of what it truly means to be a nurse simply can’t be taught in school. Help shape the next generation of care directly by working with those just starting out in their careers. In the process, you’ll very likely be reminded of why you answered that call in the first place.
