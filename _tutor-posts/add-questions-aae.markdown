Today’s students are accustomed to being able to quickly compare prices and research the risks and rewards of hiring one tutor over another. They’re more discriminating, budget-conscious, and informed than ever before, leaving many tutors seeking to find news ways to - **reach and convert** - new students.

Ask An Expert already gives tutors the platform they need to create relevant profile content that helps turn views into lessons. Now, to help you more effectively broaden your reach and [promote your brand](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/tutor/answer-impress-convert/), tutors can **post their own questions** - and answer them - on Ask An Expert. 

Why wait for a student to post that perfect question to show off your real skills? Instead, take advantage of the opportunity to create questions you know students are asking, and post a reply that could be seen by countless people searching on the web for similar help. Creating your own questions allows you to fine-tune the “*Examples of Expertise*” section of your profile with content that’s zeroed-in on your target subjects. And, most importantly, posting answers to your own questions gives you the ability to present more prepared, focused,  and polished profile content.

The most straightforward way to show students that you’re their perfect fit is to make yourself directly relevant to their needs, *at the time of their search*. Each of your answers improves the chance that web searches of similar questions will return your reply, and lead new students to your profile, so it’s important to curate your content to include the most compelling subject-specific examples of your qualifications. 

## How does it work?

To post a new question, just click the “Add Question” button once you’re logged in on Ask An Expert. Then, when you’re ready, reply using a text or video answer, exactly as you would with other Ask An Expert questions. That’s it!

Your video answers are packaged with a customized intro that shows your question, profile picture, and title, making each one a perfect digital business card for social media and sharing with students while you’re messaging. You can save your video answers by grabbing their links from Ask An Expert after they’ve been posted, or by visiting [Wyzant’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/WyzAnt/featured).

Questions created by all tutors are displayed anonymously. While your fellow tutors on Ask An Expert can answer questions you post, only **your own** answer will be displayed in your "*Examples of Expertise*."
