In February 2018 I wrote [this blog post](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/tutor/exciting-announcement-about-online-tutoring/) on the importance of online tutoring and how we expected it to grow significantly in the coming years. At the time, 36% of all Wyzant lessons were taking place online, up from 19% a year prior and a mere 6% in 2016. Last month, October 2019, a whopping **65% of all lessons on Wyzant took place online**.

There are three main drivers behind the explosive growth of online tutoring: convenience, fit, and technology.

1. It’s more **convenient** for everyone involved with no travel time or expense required.

2. With more tutors to choose from, it’s easier to find the perfect **fit**, whether based on subject expertise, availability, learning style, or other dimensions.

3. Online learning **technology** and broadband access continue to rapidly improve.

Now that the majority of student requests are for online tutoring, I highly encourage you to embrace the trend if you’ve not done so already. You can learn more about online tutoring [here](https://www.wyzant.com/online/tutor).

For those of you who do some or all of your tutoring in person, it’s worth noting that we still see an important role for in-person tutoring. For instance, we’ve seen that younger students, and those with unique learning needs, can find in-person lessons more valuable to their success. And of course, many students and parents simply prefer it. Rest assured, **Wyzant plans to continue to support in-person tutoring**. We do not, however, expect it to grow as much as online tutoring.

In closing, here are some other interesting marketplace-level differences between online and in-person tutoring:

* Online students convert **27% faster** than in-person students

* Online lessons are more efficient: **7% shorter** than in-person sessions

* Online tutors average **116% more** lessons than in-person tutors
