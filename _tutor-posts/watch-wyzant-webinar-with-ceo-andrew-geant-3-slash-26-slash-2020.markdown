Wyzant recently hosted a live webinar on March 26th, 2020. CEO Andrew Geant was joined by nearly 600 tutors to discuss [educational challenges](https://www.wyzant.com/blog/wyzant-covid-19-response-and-student-guidance/) brought about by COVID-19, best practices for tutors making the switch to online lessons, and what Wyzant is doing to better equip students and tutors to succeed in a new - perhaps unfamiliar - online learning environment.\
\
During the webinar, tutors chatted directly with Andrew, posing questions and offering valuable feedback. Those in attendance during the live feed got the chance to hear firsthand how Wyzant is working to help underprivileged students and low-income families get access to tutoring, ways in which tutors can best help their existing students moving to online, and discussed our decision to [waive the service fee for new referred students](https://support.wyzant.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041251091) from March 24, 2020, through June 30, 2020, in an effort to provide access to our powerful online learning platform to the most students possible. \
