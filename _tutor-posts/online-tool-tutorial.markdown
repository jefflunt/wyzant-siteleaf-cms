Since demand for remote learning and homeschooling has vastly increased in the last few weeks, more tutors have taken their lessons online. And what’s more: there’s never been a time where online education experts play a more crucial role. 

This shift toward distance learning certainly isn’t changing anytime soon. Online tutoring helps parents overwhelmed by the stresses of remote learning and school closures by giving their kids access to educators who provide not only expertise, but structure and focus. For students, tutoring means truly personalized support and the chance to continue working toward their education goals, even from home. For tutors, the move to online means more opportunities to connect with more students than ever before.

As a leader in online tutoring, we’ve always striven to ensure that the online lesson experience is different from other sites - more effective, easy to use, and with powerful features that accelerate the learning process. That’s why we created the Wyzant online learning tool. 

Since it’s true that new students often depend upon their tutors to help them get started in their first online lessons, we want to make sure you feel confident when a student asks for help. So we created this short video tutorial that walks you through the whole process. <br />
