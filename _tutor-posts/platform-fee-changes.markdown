A lot has changed since we started Wyzant in 2005, including the growth in subject matter taught by tutors, the rise of online tutoring, and the world around us in which education is even more critical. One area of Wyzant that has not changed in our 13 years is the tutor fee for the use of the platform. We recently made the decision to move away from the current graduated 40% - 20% platform fee percentage scale to a flat 25% platform fee, taking effect January 15. This blog post elaborates on the changes and reasoning behind them. 

Overall, the new platform fee structure will immediately benefit the majority of tutors. However, I recognize it is a significant change, especially for tutors who are at or near the 20% fee percentage. Long-term, my expectation is that you will all benefit by being part of a bigger, stronger marketplace with greater opportunities to build your business and help more students.

What is happening?

Beginning on January 15, 2019 at 10:00 am Central Time all tutors will move to a flat 25% platform fee, meaning 75% of your submitted hourly rate will be distributed to you. Please see below for how this will impact you based on your current platform fee:
