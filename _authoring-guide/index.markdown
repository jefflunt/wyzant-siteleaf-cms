### Updating the Homepage

The homepage content is configurable from the **Settings** section of the cms. In here, you can update the background image of the hero, text, and meta descriptions. Additionally, the site banner is authored here and will update every page it is present on.

### Creating Blog Posts

Blog posts are created in either the **Marketing Posts** or **Tutor Posts** section depending on which blog you are publishing to. The content is written in markdown and the article is configurable based on the meta data fields found here.

#### Available Meta Fields:

##### title:
<div class="required">REQUIRED</div>
This is the title of the blog. This title also becomes part of the url.

##### content:
<div class="required">REQUIRED</div>
Main body of the article.

##### identefier:
<div class="required">REQUIRED</div>
Do not edit this field.

##### meta-title:
<div class="optional">OPTIONAL</div>
What appears in the tab at the top of the page. If this section is not authored, the article title will be used instead.

##### author:
<div class="required">REQUIRED</div>
By default, this is set to Wyzant. This section must be authored. Refer to `Creating a New Author` below if you want an article attributed to someone other than the default Wyzant.

##### sub-headline:
<div class="optional">OPTIONAL</div>
Appears below the title on the blog index and article page

##### hero-image:
<div class="optional">OPTIONAL</div>
Appears on the top of the blog post and on the blog index. If no image is provided, we pull a default from the image library.

##### meta-description:
<div class="optional">OPTIONAL</div>
Information provided here appears in the meta description of the article. It also authors the social media (Facebook and Twitter) shares for the article. If this is not authored, the meta description gets pulled from the first 200 characters of the content.

##### post-description:
<div class="optional">OPTIONAL</div>
If provided, this becomes the article description provided on the index page.

##### tags:
<div class="optional">OPTIONAL</div>
This groups articles that are associated with each other together. Anytime you create a new tag, a `blog/tag/[tag]` page is created to group all tags together. Tutor tags are created differently. Please refer to **Creating a Tutor Tag** below to learn how to create a new tutor tag.
